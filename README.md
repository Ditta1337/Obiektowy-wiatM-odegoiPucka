## AGH University Objective Programming course 2023/2024 final project
### by Artur Dwornik and Maciej Malinowski

The final project for this course involved developing a simulation application that features two different map variants. This application enables the creation of new simulation instances, each running on a separate thread. The generation of water pools within the simulation is achieved using the Perlin noise algorithm. Here is the link to all the project [requirements](https://github.com/Soamid/obiektowe-lab/tree/master/proj) (in Polish).
